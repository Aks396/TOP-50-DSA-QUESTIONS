# System Design: Low Level Design (LLD)

While HLD focuses on the system as a whole (Srvices, DBs, LB), LLD focuses on the **internal structure** of a single component.

## 🧠 Core Objectives
- Class diagrams and inheritance hierarchies.
- Method signatures and data structures.
- Logic Flow within a module.

## 🛠️ Key Principles
- **SOLID**: (S)ingle Responsibility, (O)pen-Closed, (L)iskov Substitution, (I)nterface Segregation, (D)ependency Inversion.
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It.

## 🌉 UML (Unified Modeling Language)
- **Class Diagrams**: Showing the structure and relationships between classes.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Showing how objects interact over time.

## 🧩 Design Patterns (Application)
Applying Creational (Singleton, Factory), Structural (Adapter, Proxy), and Behavioral (Observer, Strategy) patterns to solve code-level problems.
