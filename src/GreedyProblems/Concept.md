# Concept: Greedy Algorithms

A Greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.

## 🧠 Key Traits

1. **Local Optimization**: Make the best choice at the present moment without regard for the future.
2. **Greedy Choice Property**: A global optimum can be reached by choosing a local optimum.

## 🏁 Classic Problems

- **Activity Selection**: Picking the maximum number of non-overlapping tasks.
- **Huffman Coding**: Optimal prefix codes for data compression.
- **MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)**: Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms.
- **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra's algorithm.

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

- Generally more efficient than DP if a greedy solution exists: **O(N log N)** or **O(N)**.
