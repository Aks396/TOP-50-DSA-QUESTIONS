# Concept: Dynamic Programming (DP)

DP is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

## 🧠 Key Traits

1. **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems are solved multiple times.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

## 🛠️ Common Approaches

- **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Recursive approach with a cache for results.
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Iterative approach using a DP table.

## 🏁 Classic Patterns

- **0/1 Knapsack**: Pick or skip items.
- **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)**: Comparing two strings.
- **LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence)**: Finding growth trends in arrays.
- **Bitmask DP**: Used for small constraints involving subsets.
