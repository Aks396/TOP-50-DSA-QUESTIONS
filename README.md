# Java DSA Questions & Solutions

This repository contains high-quality Java solutions for the most important Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems commonly asked in technical interviews.

## 🚀 Overview

The project includes **90+ implementation-focused solutions**, each following a dual-coding pattern to demonstrate versatility in Java:
- **Java 7 Style**: Traditional imperative approach focusing on standard logic and basic syntax.
- **Java 8+ Style**: Modern functional approach using **Stream API**, Lambdas, and functional interfaces.

## 📂 Project Structure

The code is organized into topical packages for easy navigation:

- `ArrayProblems`: Kadane's Algorithm, Rotate Array, Merge Intervals, Trapping Rain Water, etc.
- `StringProblems`: Longest Palindromic Substring, Group Anagrams, KMP Algorithm, etc.
- `LinkedListProblems`: Reverse Linked List, Detect & Remove Loop, Add Two Numbers, etc.
- `StackQueueProblems`: LRU Cache, Min Stack, Sliding Window Maximum, Celebrity Problem, etc.
- `TreeBSTProblems`: Tree Traversals, Lowest Common Ancestor, Validate BST, Max Path Sum, etc.
- `GraphProblems`: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Cycle Detection.
- `DPProblems`: 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Edit Distance, LCS.
- `SearchSortProblems`: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Counting Sort, Radix Sort.
- `BacktrackingProblems`: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Word Search, Rat in a Maze.
- `GreedyProblems`: Activity Selection, Huffman Encoding, Prim’s & Kruskal’s algorithms.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Problem Description**: Each source file includes the problem statement as a block comment.
- **Runnable Main Methods**: Every solution can be executed independently to verify outputs.
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured logic with appropriate time and space complexity considerations.
